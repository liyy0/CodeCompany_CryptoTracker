# Motivation
In today's dynamic cryptocurrency market, rapid price fluctuations present both opportunities and risks. However, individuals often find it challenging to monitor market movements continuously amidst daily activities such as travel, meals, and social engagements. Thankfully, modern technology empowers individuals to carry the functionality of a computer in their pockets through mobile phones.

In response to this need, we are developing Crypto Tracker, an app designed to provide real-time market data for every cryptocurrency along with relevant market news. By leveraging this app, users can actively engage with the crypto market at any time, whether they are investors, active traders, or simply curious about crypto trends.

Our initial concept evolved into a comprehensive app that:

- Tracks cryptocurrencies, capturing essential information such as price, volume, market cap, 24-hour price change, and daily high/low.
- Aggregates news articles related to the crypto market, offering users insights into current trends and developments.
- Incorporates a notification system to alert users when a certain price threshold is reached, enabling timely decision-making.
- Features a user-friendly search bar, eliminating the need for manual scrolling through extensive lists of cryptocurrencies.
- Provides a dedicated watchlist where users can monitor their preferred currencies, facilitating personalized market tracking.
- Includes a settings page for user feedback and communication with developers, ensuring continuous improvement and user engagement.

By offering a seamless experience for accessing real-time market data and news, Crypto Tracker empowers users to stay informed and engaged with the crypto market, anytime and anywhere.
